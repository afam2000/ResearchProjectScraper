# ResearchProjectScraper

Utility program I'm developing to help me grab empirical data for my university research course. 

Current Features:  
Lists all mods available from minecraftmods.com 
Fetches Ratings from minecraftmods.com mods  
Lists all mods from the first 26 pages of planetminecraft.com   

Bugs:  
(may be a bug with the site, the same bug occasionally happens even when manually using the site, but the scraper consistently breaks on pages larger than 26).
