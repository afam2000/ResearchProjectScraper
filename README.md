# ResearchProjectScraper

Utility program I'm developing to help me grab empirical data for my university research course. Please note this is a means rather than an end... best coding practices have been swapped for duct tape and caffeine.

Currently:  
Lists all mods available from minecraftmods.com (as of 4/2/2022, hardcoded the page amount which was 80 at the current time of development)

ToDo:  
Fetch Ratings from mods  
Save final report to file
Add functionality for atleast 1 other website.
