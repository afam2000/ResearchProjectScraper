# ResearchProjectScraper

Utility program I'm developing to help me grab empirical data for my university research course. Please note this is a means rather than an end... best coding practices have been swapped for duct tape and caffeine.

Currently:  
Fetches all mod pages from minecraftmods.com (pages 1 - 80 hardcoded)

ToDo:  
Fetch Ratings from mods  
Add functionality for atleast 1 other website.
Save final report to file
